    "body": "The eight-year-old social network that began as Mark Zuckerberg's Harvard dorm room project indicated an initial public offering price range of between $28 and $35 a share on Thursday, which would value the company at $77 billion to $96 billion.\n\nThe size of the IPO reflects the company's growth and bullish expectations about its money-making potential as a hub for everything from advertising to commerce.\n\n\"We certainly haven't ever seen a tech IPO on this grandiose a scale,\" said Lise Buyer, a principal with the IPO advisory firm Class V Group.\n\nBuyer, who worked on Google's 2004 IPO, said the question about a company \"that's already this big and that is raising this much money is how many of the glory days of growth are in the past versus how many are ahead.\"\n\nFacebook stands to raise as much as $12 billion at the upper end of its planned range. If an over-allotment or \"greenshoe\" option is triggered, the company could sweep up a maximum of $13.6 billion, according to a Thursday prospectus.\n\nFacebook is only getting about half, or $5.6 billion, of the estimated $10.6 billion that it would raise at the midpoint of its planned IPO range. About $4.9 billon will go to some existing shareholders.\n\nFacebook's stock could begin trading as soon as May 18, according to a road show schedule obtained by Reuters. The offering's price range can be adjusted depending on Wall Street's response during the road show.\n\nInvestors are expected to flock to the highly anticipated IPO, although there have been growing concerns about the social network's longer-term growth and Zuckerberg's majority control.\n\nFacebook will trade at 13 to 16 times the revenue that GreenCrest Capital analyst Max Wolff believes it will generate this year. By comparison, Google, the world's dominant Internet search engine, currently trades at 5.5 to 6 times expected 2012 revenue, he said.\n\nGoogle's valuation was higher when it went public in 2004, though Facebook's IPO valuation is still higher than Google's was back then, Wolff noted.\n\nBut some observers said the rich premium was unlikely to deter investors.\n\n\"People are going to be very comfortable with this valuation,\" said Sam Schwerin of Millennium Technology Value Partners, which owns Facebook shares worth roughly $200 million. The firm is not selling in the IPO.\n\n\"A price range of $28 to $35 will be a relief to some people who are concerned that they may try to take the highest possible price because of high demand,\" he said.\n\n\"The amount being raised is noteworthy. Selling stockholders are raising about $5 billion in the IPO, which is a lot.\"\n\nFacebook executives are due to hit the road on Monday, presenting their investment case to audiences. They will start in New York, go to other major cities such as Chicago and Boston, and end up on Facebook's home turf in Menlo Park, California, according to the schedule.\n\nZuckerberg is expected to participate in the two-week road show, a source has said, although Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and Finance Chief David Ebersman will lead the briefings.\n\nTANTALIZING WALL STREET\n\nZuckerberg's involvement in the road show will be key for investors with concerns about Facebook's long-term strategy and money-making potential, said Brian Wieser, an analyst with Pivotal Research Group.\n\nZuckerberg's control of the company -- which was underscored when he orchestrated the $1 billion acquisition of mobile app maker Instagram last month -- means that investors need to \"get comfortable\" with the 27-year-old CEO, said Wieser.\n\nLast week, Facebook reported its first quarter-to-quarter revenue slide in at least two years, a sign that the social network's sizzling growth may be cooling just as it prepares to go public. Some observers have also flagged the company's lack of revenue on mobile devices such as smartphones as an area of concern.\n\nDressed in a gray t-shirt and jeans, the copper-haired Zuckerberg appeared in a 31-minute road show video posted online on Thursday. In the video, Zuckerberg predicted that in five years almost every software app would be integrated with Facebook.\n\nFacebook generated the lion's share of its $3.7 billion in revenue last year from online advertising. It also collects fees when consumers use its special Credits currency to purchase virtual goods in social games such as Zynga's Farmville. The company has said it may expand the use of its payment business beyond games.\n\nFacebook, which plans to list its stock on the Nasdaq under the ticker \"FB\", has long tantalized investors with the prospect of a mega IPO.\n\nAs a private company, shares of Facebook have traded briskly in secondary markets for the past couple of years, as investors sought to get a piece of the fast-growing company ahead of its expected IPO.\n\nThe IPO price range indicated in Facebook's filing on Thursday would value the company a hair below the level it has traded at in the secondary markets in recent months, with some trades valuing the company at slightly more than $100 billion.\n\nBut some investors think Facebook, which touts 900 million users worldwide, is setting itself a fairly conservative target.\n\n\"The price range may be tactical. They will likely walk the range up,\" Schwerin argued.\n\nFacebook plans to sell 337.4 million shares, or 12.3 percent of the company, in the offering. The capital-raising target far outstrips big Internet IPOs that came before it. Google raised just shy of $2 billion in 2004, while last year Groupon tapped investors for $700 million and Zynga raked in $1 billion.\n\nAt the top end of the IPO range, Facebook would rival the market value of Amazon.com and Cisco Systems Inc, which are worth just over $100 billion, and surpass the combined market value of older technology companies Hewlett-Packard Co and Dell Inc.\n\nAmong existing shareholders, the largest seller in the IPO will be venture capital firm Accel Partners, which will make about $1.2 billion assuming the shares sell at the $31.5 mid-point. Zuckerberg is selling the next largest chunk of shares, worth a little under $1 billion.\n\nFacebook said that a \"substantial majority\" of the proceeds from Zuckerberg's stock sale will be used to satisfy taxes he will incur from exercising his options.\n\nIn its prospectus, Facebook said the \"lock-up\" period, during which employees cannot sell shares after the IPO, would range from 151 days to 181 days.\n\nFacebook also added two new underwriters, including online broker E*Trade Securities. The broker caters to retail clients who some have speculated may try to pile into the IPO.\n\n\"No doubt Facebook doesn't want to upset the average mom and pop out there,\" said Craig Huber, research analyst, at independent research firm Huber Research Partners.",

    "body": "The age of â€œomesâ€ is here. It began with the genome, continued with the proteome, branched out with the memome and reached full flowering with the notion of the omome.\n\nThis probably sounds like raw material for nonsense poetry, but itâ€™s a real biological and linguistic trend that makes sense, once you get the idea of just what an â€œomeâ€ is.\n\nThe genome is the place to start. It is the totality of all the genes, whether in an organism or in something else, like a\n\ntumor. \n\n\nThe human genome, mapped out about a decade ago, includes all the genes that make a human being.\n\nCreating a map of the whole genome was a monumental achievement, and during work on that project and after its completion, the omification of science took off. Joshua Lederberg, a geneticist and Nobel laureate who died in 2008, and Alexa T. McCray, now an associate professor at Harvard Medical School, saw it coming, and talked about the origin of the suffix â€œomeâ€ in a 2001 essay, â€œ â€™Ome Sweet â€™Omics â€” A Genealogical Treasury of Words,â€ in The Scientist.\n\nThe word â€œgenomeâ€ was first used in 1920, by Hans Winkler, a German scientist, to mean all the material on the chromosomes in a sperm or egg, but did not become really popular until the end of the last century, when genome mapping began. Various experts had differing ideas on where the suffix came from, but it seems to be one that was made up. In any case, it clearly meant the totality of something. Dr. Lederberg, who coined a few scientific terms himself, contributed â€œmicrobiomeâ€ â€” all the microbes that live in and on humans â€” to the growing trend.\n\nAn epidemic of neologia ensued. Thus were born the proteome and the secretome and the glycome, and numerous other omes that are pretty much impossible to keep track of. Interactome. Regulome. Connectome. Epigenome. The list goes on. In fact, it goes on for about 18 pages if you go to the Omics.org site and print out its list of omes and omics.\n\nThe list could be said to be the omome, the ome of all the omes, a word which, in a moment of indulgent fantasy, I thought perhaps I had invented. Apparently not. â€œOmome,â€ or â€œomeome,â€ is on the Omics.org list, although the Web site given as a source led nowhere. Another possible inventor is Martin Krzywinski, a scientist at the Genome Sciences Center in Vancouver, British Columbia. He has created some extraordinary visual representations of genomes, and also invents new words. Among the coinings he offers on his site are â€œomome,â€ â€œomeomics,â€ â€œomicsophy,â€ which I donâ€™t think will ever take off, and, just Thursday, â€œmetaomomics,â€ which I donâ€™t even want to think about.\n\nI loved the idea of the omome, but I thought it needed a reality check. I called Mark Gerstein at Yale. His lab is deeply involved in bioinformatics, the use of computing to make sense of the vast amounts of information produced in pursuit of the various omes. Dr. Gerstein also has an interest in the way scientific terminology develops.\n\nThe omome, he said, was a fun idea, but he doubted anyone was making a living in omomics. Despite the humor in speculative omification, he said, the proliferation of real omic disciplines marked the spread of a â€œvery important scientific idea.â€ He said, â€œAll the omes derive to some extent from the genome,â€ and key to all of them is that an ome represents â€œthe entirety of the thing being studied.â€\n\nThe mapping of genomes, he said, inspired scientists to use the same approach in studying proteins, metabolites and their biochemical connections, to name a few. And as they pursued this â€œomic idea,â€ the focus of biological research shifted in the direction of studying complete systems and networks, rather than individual parts, discrete genes or proteins.\n\nHis comments reminded me of a recent conversation I had when I was reporting on the evolution of polar bears. One scientist wanted to make it clear to me that she was studying genomics, whereas another researcher was studying only genes. Only genes, I thought? What a difference an ome can make.",

    "body": "Today we worked in the Teresina area for the first time this year. We decided we would return to the quarry outside the town of Timon, where we found a very interesting fish skull last year. Weâ€™re just starting to prepare that specimen, so I canâ€™t offer many details about it at this point, but it certainly seems to have a lot of potential. Based on that specimen, our expectations were high, and the quarry did not disappoint.\n\nNot long after arriving today, Martha Richter literally stumbled across a partial skeleton of a terrestrial vertebrate, or tetrapod, preserved in a few pieces of rock in one of the quarry spoil piles. The main layer of the quarry that is used for paving material is the hard red siltstone that forms much of the vertical walls. However, at the base of the wall and exposed in some other areas, there is a softer sandstone that is too friable to use for paving, which is why pieces of it are mostly discarded.\nItâ€™s not an exaggeration to say that this specimen is the most exciting that weâ€™ve found in our two years of fieldwork in the ParnaÃ­ba Basin. It appears to represent a type of amphibian and has a fairly short, broad skull that lacks the very elongated snout of the Prionosuchus. Therefore it is definitely something new to the basin. The size and shape are a bit reminiscent of the little jaw fragment that Domingas found a few days ago, so it might represent that animal. More preparation of both specimens will be necessary to say definitively whether thatâ€™s the case.\n\nBeyond that, there was a lot of discussion of which group of amphibians the specimen might be part of, based on our attempts to interpret the anatomy exposed in the specimen. A couple of our guesses focused on two groups, the microsaurs and the amphibamids. Both are known exclusively from areas in the Northern Hemisphere during the Permian period, so finding one south of the paleo-equator would be an important discovery. Again, more preparation of the specimen will be necessary to be sure, and weâ€™re all already thinking about what might be the best ways to approach this process. Every specimen is a unique problem when it comes to preparation, and the way this one is preserved suggests it will require a particularly delicate touch.\n\nLuckily, the excitement of finding the skeleton was enough to keep us motivated for the rest of the day. It was very hot today, even by local standards, and the only other fossils we found in the quarry during the rest of our searching were small, unidentifiable fragments of bone. The plan for tomorrow is to do more prospecting for fossils in a couple of other quarries in the area. Our discovery today has given us an idea of what rock layer will be good to target, and it would be great if we can find more material like this",
